#RNA Folding

---
###Description:
This program will brute force the lowest energy RNA folding pattern
for a given sequence of RNA base pairs on a 2D grid, 3D grid,
2D ungridded, and 3D ungridded

###Goals:
####Completed:
* README

####Short Term Plans:
#####Gavin:
* Brute force optimal RNA sequence shap
#####Louis:
* Display RNA sequence shape

####Long Term Plans:
* 3D grid
* 2D no grid
* 3D no grid
